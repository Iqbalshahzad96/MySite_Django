# MySite_Django
This is a Django Project I created to learn and understand Django python along Udemy course

In This Project I have created two apps
    FirstApp
    FormApp

FirstApp is in main branch of repository. In firstApp created Views, Urls and models. Connected the urls with views in App. Make the migrations for the models and use those models in the views. Have made the static and template forlders in project and added files respectively. Used static and templates files with App's views to show the results on Webpage. Maintain the Model-View-Template Structure of the Django in this App.

FormApp is in formsApp branch of the repository. In FormApp created Views, Urls and Forms. Connected the urls with views in App and use forms in the views. Have made the template forlder in project and added a template file. Used templates file with App's views to show the results on Webpage. Maintain the Form-View-Template Structure of the Django in this App.
